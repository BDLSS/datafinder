Data Finder is an online catalogue of data produced as a result of research by scholars at the University of Oxford. Use DataFinder to search for datasets. Datasets might comprise numerical data images, audio, text corpus, computational data or other form.

Use Data Finder to:
- Search and Browse for Oxford datasets
- Assess the relevance of the dataset to your needs: many records include a description and descriptive terms about the dataset.
- Locate Data might be in digital or physical format. DataFinder will provide details of how to locate the data whatever the format. It might provide a UAL directly to the source of the data or contact details to request access to the datoset. Datasets are not necessarily located within the University of Oxford.
- Access datasets (where permitted). Finding details of a dataset via Data Finder does not guarantee access to that dataset: each dataset will hove its own access terms and conditions.

Data Finder is being developed with funding generously provided by JISC. Data Finder is managed and maintained by the Bodleian Libraries> as a part of the DaMaRo project

The Data Management Rollout at Oxford (DaMaRO) Project is creating a research data management policy for the University and the infrastructure to enable researchers to comply with it.

The Datafinder enables the discovery of data hosted in various places around the University and beyond, including the 'DataBank' and 'VIDAAS'. DataFinder is freely available as a web service.
